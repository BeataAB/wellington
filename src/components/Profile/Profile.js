            <p>Wellington arrived to our household on the 21st August 2021, a rescue from 'Happy Spanish Tails Charity'.</p>
            <p>Rescuing a dog is always a daunting experience, there is little know as to the dogs background and behaviour. We have embarked on this journey with open heart and mind and even though it was challenging at times we wouldn't change it, we absolutely fell in love with this beautiful guy!</p>
            <p>Wellie is a very affectionate dog, his facial expressions and noises convey his happiness, playfulness and discontent when a treat pouch is getting closed.</p>
            <h2>Favourite activities</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Wellie is obsessed with fetch, balls are his favourite toys!</li>
                <li>He loves running on the beach and digging in the sand.</li>
                <li>Never says no to snuggles and cuddles.</li>
                <li>Enjoys playing hide and seek with some treats or fregnant toys.</li>
                <li>Breakfast and dinner are the most important events in his life, if he could, he would inhale his food, thank goodness somebody came up with a slow-feeding bowl.</li>
